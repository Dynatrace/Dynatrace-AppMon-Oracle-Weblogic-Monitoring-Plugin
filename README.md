## Oracle Weblogic Monitoring Plugin

![images/oracle_logo.png](images/oracle_logo.png)

Monitoring is a proactive, not reactive, approach to system management. That is what the Weblogic plugin is trying to provide. We have the ability to extract data that can be used for monitoring/alerting purposes, but having this history we can also start using the data for capacity planning and configuration validation (did we make things better or worse). This plugin makes collecting and storing Weblogic data easy. Add this to the graphical ability of dynaTrace and we now have a light weight and high result proactive monitoring solution.

This plugin allows you to gather metrics available in the Oracle WebLogic Console. In addition, it can also acquire the value of the oldest message in the JMS queue. The plugin collects system metric through auto discovery. This means no configuration is needed when adding or removing resources.
